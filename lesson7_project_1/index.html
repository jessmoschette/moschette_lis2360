            <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>

            <p>Hitting the gym and working out is something that a lot of people dread and do not look forward to, but it is also easy to learn to love it. Not only will it make you look better, but you will also feel so much better when you start squeezing exercise into your daily schedule. It is hard at the beginning and can be a little bit frustrating, but it is important to keep going and know it is all worth it. Learning can be tricky, but consistency is key.</p>
            
            
            <p>There are a lot of misconceptions about working out and body types when it comes to females. It is so easy to compare yourself to others and have unrealisitc expectations, but overcoming that and learning to accept and love your body is so important in this life. Setting goals and working hard to achieve them is the only way that will bring expectations into reality. Social media has very much influenced and messed with peoples' heads when it comes to what an ideal female body should look like, but it has also motivated more women to start working out and prioritizing their health.</p>
            
            
            <p>Some of these misconceptions as mentioned before include thoughts such as: heavy weightlifting makes you bulky, avoiding eating, only doing cardio, and many other things just like this. These things are simply not true, and getting educated on what you are doing makes the process much easier and more enjoyable. Through all of the hardships that come with working out, sticking to it will lead to loving the process and knowing that the struggle is worth it.</p>
            
            
            <p>Heavy weightlifting actually gives women more athletic and tight muscles with curves as well, and it is much harder for a female to get bulky. It is hard enough for men and they have 10-15x more testosterone than women. When it comes to eating, the main problem is overeating and not knowing portion control. Clean eating is important, but so is knowing how much of it to eat. And when it comes to cardio, yes, it is important in losing weight. But, it is not the only way to do so and you have to actually be careful with the amount that you do if you are trying to achieve a certain figure!</p>
